# ssid_resolver_flutter - "Get my Wifi Name"

A flutter plugin to resolve the SSID of the connected wireless LAN, or simply: "Get my Wi-Fi Name".  

**TLDR: Add the mixin class `SSIDResolverMixin` to your view and implement the `onSSIDResolved` method.**

This will trigger the permission request dialog if needed and resolve the SSID in one step. 
See below: [Using SSIDResolver Mixin](#1-using-ssidresolver-mixin).

---

Over the years, the number of permissions required to access the wireless network name has increased 
in both the iOS and Android Operating System and this implementation was tested successfully on both 
systems in early 2025. I couldn't get existing plugins to work or maybe failed to use them properly, 
so I created this one.

To resolve the name, the SSID of the Wi-Fi, your phone is connected to, you have to get a bunch of 
permission settings right that have to be statically set in your code for this plugin to work. Next 
you need the users consent to give you "Location Permissions".

The contained example app: [debug_app.dart](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/blob/master/example/lib/debug_app.dart) 
is a perfect starting point, to figure out any permission issues you might have. It will show you exactly what you are missing.

Below you can see the example app in action. On the left side you see the Android app and on the right side the iOS app.

This plugin is based on my two standalone implementations for [iOS](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid-resolver-ios)
and [Android](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid-resolver-android), both available on GitHub.

# Usage and Configuration

## SSID Resolution Flow

The SSID resolver provides three key methods:

- `resolveSSID()`: Returns the connected WiFi SSID or 'Unknown'
- `checkPermissionStatus()`: Verifies required permissions
- `requestPermission()`: Handles permission requests

### Typical Usage Flow
1. Check permission status
2. Request permissions if needed
3. Resolve SSID

Note: On iOS, WiFi access requires location permissions, even with XCode WiFi capability configured.

# Usage

The plugin is available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/ssid_resolver_flutter). To use the plugin 
in your project, add `ssid_resolver_flutter` as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
  ssid_resolver_flutter: ^x.y.z
```

In the folder [example/lib](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/tree/master/example/lib) you can 
find examples app that use this plugin, see below for a more detailed discussion. The important configuration 
parts for iOS and Android are listed below.

## iOS Permission Configuration

Needs these permissions in the `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to location to determine the WiFi information.</string>
<key>NSLocationUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to location to determine the WiFi information.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to location to determine the WiFi information.</string>
<key>com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info</key>
<true/>
```

And also the "Access WiFi Information". Either open `<project_root>/ios/Runner/Runner.xcodeproj` in XCode 
and go to "Signing & Capabilities". Add the "Access WiFi Information" capability.

| Add WiFi Capability 1                                                                                                                                        | Add WiFi Capability 2                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/master/res//add-wifi-capability-1.png" alt="Add WiFi Capability 1" width="400"/> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/master/res//add-wifi-capability-2.png" alt="Add WiFi Capability 2" width="400"/> |      

This should produce the file `<project_root>/ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements` with this content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## Android Permission Configuration

For Android, the `AndroidManifest.xml` file needs these permissions: 

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE" />
```

And also the following queries:

```xml
<queries>
    <package android:name="com.google.android.gms" />
    <package android:name="com.android.settings" />
</queries>
```

# Examples

All examples are available in the [example/lib](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/tree/master/example/lib) folder. 
Use the [debug_app.dart](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/blob/master/example/lib/debug_app.dart)
to fix your permissions issues. The example app demonstrates the usage of the plugin in a simple way, 
showing all the granted and missing permissions. 

Note that only the location permissions need user consent and the other ones have to be granted in the 
`AndroidManifest.xml` for Android, and `Info.plist` and `Runner.entitlements` files in the case of iOS, 
as mentioned above. It's important to note, that the permissions are given by the client code of this 
plugin, not the plugin itself. 

Just follow the examples and the permission files of the "example app", 
[here for Android](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/blob/master/example/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)
and [here](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/blob/master/example/ios/Runner/Info.plist) 
and [here for iOS](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/blob/master/example/ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements).

## 1. Using SSIDResolver Mixin

Add the mixin class `SSIDResolverMixin` to your view and implement the `onSSIDResolved` method.
This will trigger the permission request dialog if needed and resolve the SSID in one step.

Here is the full client code that takes full advantage of the plugin for Wi-Fi SSID resolution:

```dart
    class MyClientOne extends StatefulWidget {
      const MyClientOne({super.key});
      @override
      State<MyClientOne> createState() => _MyClientOneState();
    }
    
    class _MyClientOneState extends State<MyClientOne> with SSIDResolverMixin<MyClientOne> {
      String _ssid = '';
    
      @override
      void onSSIDChanged(String ssid) {
        setState(() => 
          _ssid = ssid
        );
      }
    
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Center(
          child: Text(_ssid),
        );
      }
    }
```

The source code is here: [ssidresolver_mixin_example.dart](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/blob/master/example/lib/ssidresolver_mixin_example.dart).
If you need more fine-grained control, on when the SSID is resolved or when the permission dialog should 
be shown, look below at the "Do It Yourself" example.

## 2. Using SSIDHelper

Once the user gives the "location permission", the SSID can be resolved. And because the "location 
permission" step only has to happen once in your apps lifetime, why bother and make things complicated?
If there are other screens that appear in your app before you trigger the SSID resolution, you can 
use the `SSIDHelper` class to do the initialization and permission request way before you actually 
need the SSID.

This greatly simplifies the flow of your app, as you don't need to handle the "re-entry" event, after 
the phone operating system is handing you back the control and the result of the permission dialog.

Use the `SSIDHelper` class to do the initialization and permission request (or do the same that it 
does internally) after your app starts up. The call to `_ssidManager.initialize()` will trigger the 
permission request dialog if needed.

On subsequent screens, you can then call `getSSID()` to get the SSID without having to worry about 
the permission dialog.

```dart
    final ssidHelper = SSIDHelper();
    
    @override
    void initState() {
      super.initState();
      _ssidManager.initialize();
    }
```

Don't forget to call `_ssidManager.dispose();` in your `dispose` method.

Now, on the screen where you need the SSID, you can simply call `_ssidManager.getSSID()`:

```dart
    Future<void> _resolveSSID() async {
      final ssid = await _ssidManager.getSSID();
      setState(() => _ssid = ssid);
    }
```

These two steps are combined in the example app: [ssidhelper_example.dart](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/blob/master/example/lib/ssidhelper_example.dart).
You will notice that the SSID only resolves after you click the button for the second time.

## 3. "Do It Yourself"

This example shows how to use the plugin "hands-on". To get the permissions, the OS opens it's own 
modal dialog and the later returns to the app. If you need full control over the process, you therefore need
to use the `WidgetsBindingObserver`, register your class as an observer and implement the `didChangeAppLifecycleState` method.
Have a look at the "Do It Yourself" implementation that can be found in  the example app folder 
here: [do_it_yourself_example.dart](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/blob/master/example/lib/do_it_yourself_example.dart).

Below is part of the source code. In the case permissions are not yet granted, the OS will 
take over and show the permission dialog. Thus, when the app is resumed, the observer will check 
the permission status and continue the flow.

```dart
class _MyClientThreeState extends State<MyClientThree> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  final _ssidResolver = SSIDResolver();
  String _ssid = '';
  bool _isRequestingPermission = false;
  Timer? _permissionCheckTimer;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _permissionCheckTimer?.cancel();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed && _isRequestingPermission) {
      _checkPermissionAndContinue();
    }
  }

  Future<void> _checkPermissionAndContinue() async {
    _permissionCheckTimer?.cancel();
    _isRequestingPermission = false;

    final permissionStatus = await _ssidResolver.checkPermissionStatus();
    if (permissionStatus.isGranted) {
      final ssid = await _ssidResolver.resolveSSID();
      setState(() => _ssid = ssid);
    } else {
      setState(() => _ssid = "Permission denied");
    }
  }

  Future<void> _getSSID() async {
    setState(() => _ssid = "Checking permissions...");

    final initialStatus = await _ssidResolver.checkPermissionStatus();
    if (initialStatus.isGranted) {
      final ssid = await _ssidResolver.resolveSSID();
      setState(() => _ssid = ssid);
      return;
    }

    _isRequestingPermission = true;
    await _ssidResolver.requestPermission();

    // Check immediately in case no modal was shown
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 100));
    if (!_isRequestingPermission) return;

    await _checkPermissionAndContinue();

    // Set up periodic checks in case the app didn't lose focus
    _permissionCheckTimer = Timer.periodic(
      const Duration(milliseconds: 100),
          (_) => _checkPermissionAndContinue(),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
          ...
          // SSID Result Display
          Container(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(12),
            decoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: const Color(0xFFE0E0E0),
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
            ),
            child: Text(
              _ssid,
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
              style: const TextStyle(
                color: Color(0xFF142467),
                fontSize: 30,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
          ),
          ...
    );
  }
}
```

# Troubleshooting

If you run into permissions issues, make sure to check the permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` 
and `Info.plist` files as described above and try running the app on a real device instead of the emulator. 
iOS will not give you a SSID on the simulator. 

Also run the example app: [debug_app.dart](https://github.com/raoulsson/ssid_resolver_flutter/blob/master/example/lib/debug_app.dart) and check the output. 
That should show which permissions are missing.

I hope this helps.
